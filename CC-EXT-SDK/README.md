# Creative Cloud Extension SDK

(THIS IS THE CEP5 BRANCH)

Unofficial SDK for building HTML based extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud applications.
As of now, it consists of some command line tool / scripts and some templates.


 
### createext 

Creates an extension panel from a given template and deploys it.

Usage: 

* osx: `createext.sh templatename extid`
* win: `createext.bat templatename extid`

Parameters:

* `templatename` the name of the template folder you wish to use as a source
* `extid` a unique id for your extension

Returns: the path of the created folder.

Example: `createext.sh default com.example.ext`  ... will create the extension *com.example.ext* from the `default` template located in the `templates/default` folder. The extension panel should be ready to use from the corresponding Adobe application as long as you've enable debugging on the system (see the `debugmode` commands below).

You can of course add your own templates to the `templates` folder.


### deployext

Copies an existing extension folder to the appropriate location for it to be executed.

Usage:

* osx : `deployext.sh extfolder extid`
* win : `deployext.bat extfolder extid`

Parameters:

* `extfolder` the location of the extension folder you wish to deploy
* `extid` the extension unique id (ie `com.example.my_ext`)

Returns: the path of the created folder.


Example: To deploy an extension located at `~/my-awesome-ext/` with the ID `com.example.awesome-ext`, run:

`deployext.sh ~/my-awesome-ext/ com.example.awesome-ext`

For a sample extension to start with, check out my [Creative Cloud Extension boilerplate](https://github.com/davidderaedt/ccext-boilerplate).


### setdebugmode and disabledebugmode

For extensions to run, you should first run `setdebugmode.sh` (mac) or `setdebugmode.bat` (win) once to properly configure your system for extension development. Otherwise, extensions will refuse to launch.
`disabledebugmode.sh` reverts to the default behavior. Windows users should update the CEP registry key manually.

### execextendscript

This shell script can be used to execute an ExtendScript file in Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign on a mac via command line. Unfortunately, there is no windows equivalent for now.

Usage (osx): `execextendscript <application> <filepath>`

Parameters:

* `application`: "ps" (Photoshop CC), "ai" (Illustrator CC) or "id" (InDesign CC)
* `filepath`: file path of the JSX file to be executed.
